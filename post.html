<h1>Biggest image in the smallest space</h1>

<p>
What’s the biggest pixel size of a PNG image in the
smallest number of bytes? I wanted to try to create an image that could
be downloaded but whose pixel buffer would be too big to store in the
RAM of a PC. Here is a bzip2 file of 420 bytes that uncompresses to a
PNG image of 6,132,534 bytes (5.8 MB) and 225,000 &times; 225,000 pixels
(50.625 gigapixels), which, if represented as a pixel buffer of 3 bytes
per pixel, takes about 141.4 GB.

The program used to make it: <a href="/bzr/deflate/deflate.py">deflate.py</a>.

PNG uses <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951">DEFLATE</a>
compression in a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950">zlib</a>
wrapper. DEFLATE can asymptotically approach a compression ratio of
1032:1: each pair of bits can represent 258 zero bytes, and then there’s
some constant overhead for headers and such.
</p>

<p>
The image is almost entirely zeroes, with a secret message in the
center. We gain an extra factor of 8 pixels by using a 1-bit colorspace.
Even with this maximum compression, the PNG file is basically a long
string of zero bytes. bzip2 has a run-length preprocessing step that
crunches these megabytes into a few hundred bytes.

Things to try:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload as your profile picture to some online service, try to crash
their image processing scripts.</li>
<li>Set as your web site’s favicon; try to crash browsers that don’t
check the size.</li>
</ul>
